Because I am not going to implement them... so I just write some notes here...

History: R-CNN -> Fast R-CNN -> Faster R-CNN -> Mask R-CNN

### R-CNN

The first paper using CNN: image classification -> object detection

4 steps:
  * Region proposals (images -> selective search -> top 2000 proposals)
  * Feature extraction of each propsals (proposals -> AlexNet -> 4096-dim feature vector)
  * Object category classifiers (feature vector -> k SVM -> k-dim vector -> overlap filter)
  * Bounding-box regression (linear function of feature vector of P)

Proposal overlap filter:
  * a greedy non-maximum suppression (for each class independently) that rejects a region if it has an intersection-overunion (IoU) overlap with a higher scoring selected region larger than a learned threshold.

Trainning:
  * Positive and negative exmaples
  * AlexNet
  * SVM
  * Bounding-box regression

### Fast R-CNN
  
Improvements:
  * The RoI pooling layer
  * The softmax classifier
  * bbox fully connected layer
  
4 steps:
  * Region proposals (images -> selective search -> top 2000 proposals)
  * Feature extraction of each propsals (proposals -> VGG + RoI pooling layer -> $H \times W$ feature map)
  * Object category classifiers (feature map -> FC + (k + background) softmax -> (k+1)-dim vector -> overlap filter) 
  * Bounding-box regression (feature map -> FC -> bbox)

### Faster R-CNN

Improvments:
  * Region Proposal Networks: make the whole model become a single unified network
  
5 steps:
  * Feature map (images -> VGG -> feature map)
  * Region proposals (feature map -> Region Proposal Networks -> $(W \times H \times k)$ proposals with scores -> top 2000 + overlap filter)
  * Feature extraction of each propsals (feature map + proposals -> RoI pooling layer -> $(H \times W)$ feature map)
  * Object category classifiers (feature map -> FC + (k + background) softmax -> (k+1)-dim vector) 
  * Bounding-box regression (feature map -> FC -> bbox)

RPN:
  * input: $W \times H$ feature map
  * k anchor boxes
  * each boxes has two scores: object or non-object.
  * output: $W \times H \times(4k)$ coordinates, $W \times H \times (2k)$ scores
Training:
  * Alternating training

### Mask R-CNN

Improvments:
  * backbone: ResNeXt-101+FPN
  * RoIAlign: use bilinear interpolation to compute the exact values of the input features at four regularly sampled locations in each RoI bin, and aggregate the result (using max or average)
  * Mask branch: FCN ([Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf))
  
FCN:
  * Convnet
  * Upsampling
  * DAG Net

6 steps:
  * Feature map (images -> backbone -> feature map)
  * Region proposals (feature map -> Region Proposal Networks -> $(W \times H \times k)$ proposals with scores -> top 2000 + overlap filter)
  * Feature extraction of each propsals (feature map + proposals -> RoIAlign -> $(H \times W)$ feature map)
  * Object category classifiers (feature map -> FC + (k + background) softmax -> (k+1)-dim vector) 
  * Bounding-box regression (feature map -> FC -> bbox)
  * Mask branch (feature map -> head -> FCN -> k mask proposals)
