# Implementation of Coroutine in Cpp

If you are interesting in how to write a python generator or lua coroutine in C++, this code does the job for you!

I am not going to explain how it works, but if you are interested, feel free to read the source code...

I wrote some blogs on the story of how I came up with this idea, but all of them are in Chinese. Read them here: [Cartesian Product](https://freopen.com/lang/2020/08/11/Cartesian-Product.html) and [Cartesian Product 2](https://freopen.com/lang/2020/11/19/Cartesian-Product-2.html)

This small implememation is very easy to use, so I wrote an usage manual in the souece code to show how to use it. 

If you still have any questions on how to use it, or some new ideas on this topic, feel free to send me an email.

Hope you enjoy my code, and have fun to play it! :)
