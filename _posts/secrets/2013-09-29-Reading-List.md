System Design Problems
  - [x] System Design Interviews: A step by step guide
  - [x] Designing a URL Shortening service like TinyURL
    - Let's design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. This service will provide short aliases redirecting to long URLs.
    - Similar services: bit.ly, goo.gl, qlink.me, etc.
    - Difficulty Level: Easy
    - KGS, Data Partition, Cache, Load Balance
  - [x] Designing Pastebin
    - Let's design a Pastebin like web service, where users can store plain text. Users of the service will enter a piece of text and get a randomly generated URL to access it. 
    - Similar Services: pastebin.com, pasted.co, chopapp.com 
    - Difficulty Level: Easy
    - Metadata database and Object storage
  - [ ] Designing Instagram
