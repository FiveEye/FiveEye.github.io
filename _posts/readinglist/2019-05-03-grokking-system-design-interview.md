  - [ ] Proxies
  - [ ] Redundancy and Replication
  - [ ] SQL vs. NoSQL
  - [ ] CAP Theorem

  - [ ] Long-Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events

## SQL vs. NoSQL

The most common types of NoSQL:
  * Key-Value Stores: Redis
  * Document Databases: MongoDB
  * Wide-Column Databases: HBase
  * Graph Databases

High level differences between SQL and NoSQL:
  * Storage
  * Schema
  * Querying
  * Scalability
  * Reliability or ACID Compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

Reasons to use SQL database:
  * ensure ACID compliance.
  * data is structured and unchanging.

Reasons to use NoSQL database:
  * data is no structured
  * cloud computing
  * repid development

## Consistent Hashing
